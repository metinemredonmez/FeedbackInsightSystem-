# ‚úàÔ∏è Turkish Airlines ‚Äì Passenger Feedback Insight System (FEIS)

## What is FEIS?

**FEIS (Flight Experience Intelligence System)** is a next-generation, modular AI platform designed for airlines to deeply analyze passenger feedback using state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) orchestration. Built as a multi-agent, node-based architecture, FEIS allows for real-time voice-to-insight workflows, hallucination-resistant outputs, and explainable AI-driven suggestions to drive continuous improvement in aviation.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Voice-to-Insight**: Directly ingest audio (voice feedback) from passengers and instantly convert to actionable text using OpenAI Whisper.
- **Node-Driven Orchestration**: Modular, node-based flow including transcription, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), hallucination detection, grounding, and CrewAI agent orchestration.
- **Grounded AI**: Built-in hallucination prevention using fact-checking (FFSDB) and smart agent-to-agent (A2A) coordination.
- **Full-stack Demo**: FastAPI backend, Streamlit interactive demo panel, and cloud-ready Docker deployment.
- **CI/CD Ready**: GitHub Actions for build, test, and automatic GCP Cloud Run deployment.

## ‚ú® System Flow

1. **Passenger Feedback (Audio/Voice or Text)**
2. **TranscribeNode**: Audio ‚Üí Text (OpenAI Whisper)
3. **RAGNode**: Retrieve relevant operational documents (LangChain + Pinecone)
4. **GroundingNode**: Fact-check feedback with FFSDB (fact store)
5. **HallucinationCheckerNode**: Flag hallucinations before agent synthesis
6. **A2AOrchestrationNode**: Coordinate CrewAI agents for consensus
7. **SpeakNode**: (Optional) Respond to user as synthesized voice/text

## üß© Architecture

- **Multi-Agent (CrewAI):**  
  - Captain, Researcher, Observer, Analyst ‚Äî each handling a unique perspective in feedback analysis.
- **Modular Node Structure:**  
  - Each task (transcription, retrieval, grounding, orchestration) is a composable Python class (node).
- **Explainability & Trust:**  
  - Hallucination risk flagged and prevented before AI suggestions are shown.
- **Grounding/Fact Store (FFSDB):**  
  - Real-world facts and incident patterns are matched before any AI output.
